# About #

BCNS is a collection of BFS and Random Walk network samples of collaborative filtering recommendations from the Amazon.com U.S. site collected in February 2014. This repository does not include the data (contact authors for data) but will include R scripts to import and transform the data to make it more useful. It may be expanded to include other languages if there is sufficient demand. Please send a pull request if there are specific operations or languages you would like to see added.
